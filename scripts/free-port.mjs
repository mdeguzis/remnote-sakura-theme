/**
 * Free the dev server port, but only from our own server.
 *
 * webpack-dev-server dies with EADDRINUSE if anything already holds the port,
 * and the usual cause is a previous run of this project that was never stopped,
 * or was stopped in a way that left the listener behind. Restarting then fails
 * for a reason that has nothing to do with the change you just made.
 *
 * The important restriction is in the name: only OUR server. Blindly killing
 * whatever holds port 8080 would take out someone else's unrelated dev server,
 * which is a far worse failure than the one being fixed. So every candidate is
 * checked first, and anything foreign is reported and left alone.
 *
 * "Ours" means this repo OR a sibling RemNote theme. The themes share a port and
 * only one can be developed at a time, so hitting the other one's server is the
 * normal case when switching between them, not an accident. Refusing there just
 * meant reading a pid out of an error message and killing it by hand every time.
 * A sibling is identified by the `name` in the package.json above its working
 * directory, which is a much narrower signal than "something on port 8080".
